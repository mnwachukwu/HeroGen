<h4><a name="save">Save up to Four Characters!</a></h4>
<b>HeroGen</b> allows the user to save up to four characters:

<li>three others accessible through the <b>File</b> button in the top portion of the upper
    frame

<ul>
<li>Selecting a hero in the list box then clicking on the <b>Load</b> button will swap that
    hero with the hero currently being worked on.
<li>Selecting a hero in the list box then clicking on the <b>Delete</b> button will delete that
    hero.
</ul>

<hr>
<h4><a name="abilities">Abilities</a></h4>
<b>HeroGen</b> allows each of the six ability scores to be assigned:
<ul>
<li>Strength
<li>Dexterity
<li>Constitution
<li>Intelligence
<li>Will
<li>Personality

<h4><a name="skills">Skills</a></h4>
<b>HeroGen</b> allows the selection of all of the standard skills, broad and specialty.
<p>
(The optional psionic skills are not <i>yet</i> implemented.)
<p>
Each hero starts out with the free broad skills defined by his species.
<p>
Checking a broad skill's check box enables its specialty skills. Up to 12 specialty skill ranks
may be selected.
<p>
Unchecking a broad skill's check box wipes out all information for its associated specialty
skills.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Note</b>:
<dd>When a new species is selected, all broad and specialty skills are wiped out and replaced
    with that species' free broad skills.
</dl>
<p>
Where applicable, a short description will appear to the right of the skills. If the
description's font is <b>bold</b>, the skill's impact has already been reflected in the
character sheet.
<ul>
<li>A description at the ability level applies to all its broad and specialty skills.
<li>A description at the broad skill level applies to all its specialty skills.
</ul>
<p>
When the selection of skills is complete, the skills window should be closed.

<hr>
<h4><a name="perks_flaws">Perks &amp; Flaws</a></h4>
<b>HeroGen</b> allows the selection of all of the standard perks and flaws.
<p>
The perks and flaws selected will show up in the <b>Game Data</b> section of the character
sheet.
<p>
Each perk and flaw selected affects the total skill points scored.
<p>
Each hero is limited to three perks and three flaws.
<p>
The following perks and flaws cannot be selected at the same time:
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<th>Perk</th><th>Flaw</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Filthy Rich</td><td>Dirt Poor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fortitude</td><td>Fragile</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Good Luck</td><td>Bad Luck</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Great Looks</td><td>Poor Looks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Observant</td><td>Oblivious</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
For example, if the <b>Filthy Rich</b> perk is purchased, then the <b>Dirt Poor</b> flaw cannot
also be purchased.
<p>
Perks in <i>italics</i> may <b>only</b> be purchased when the hero is created:
<ul>
<li>Alien Artifact
<li>Faith
<li>Filthy Rich
<li>Good Luck
<li>Great Looks
<li>Heightened Ability

<b>HeroGen</b> allows the selection of all of the standard weapons and armor.
<p>
Each hero is permanently given the <b>Unarmed</b> melee weapon.
<br>
(Unless the hero has no arms... wait a minute... he'd still be unarmed! :-)
<p>
<b>T'sa</b> heroes automatically receive natural body armor.
<p>
Checking the <b>Weapon Accuracy</b> check box causes a weapon's base situation die to be
adjusted by its accuracy.
<p>
In addition to the standard <b>Weapon Data</b> table, the character sheet also has an <b>Armor Data</b> table.
<h5>Back to <a href="#features">Features</a></h5>
<hr>
<h4><a name="cybernetic_gear">Cybernetic Gear</a></h4>
<b>HeroGen</b> allows the selection of all of the standard cybernetic gear.
<p>
Gear marked with a single asterisk requires a Nanocomputer.
<ul>
<li>If a hero has gear requiring a Nanocomputer installed and unchecks the Nanocomputer
    check box, <b>HeroGen</b> will prompt the user to verify this action. If the user answers
	affirmatively, this gear will be uninstalled.
	<br>
	(<a href="#custom">Custom cybernetic gear</a> will remain installed...
	 its property will be changed to not require a Nanocomputer.)
</ul>
<p>
Gear marked with two asterisks can be installed at no cost in skill points.
<p>
<b>Mechalus</b> heroes are initially given a Good-quality Nanocomputer, a Passive Data Slot,
and Reflex.
<br>
(This gear does not use up the Mechalus hero's Cyber Tolerance boxes.)
